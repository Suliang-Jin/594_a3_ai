        <div class="section" style="border: 2px solid transparent; padding: 15px; margin: 5px 0; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #f0f0f0;">
            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to humor rating task, enpowered by AI-generated context! 🎉</p>
            <p>In this task, you will see an <em>original news headline</em> and an <em>edited version with one word replaced</em>. Your goal is to rate how funny the edited version is (less funny 👎, mediocre 😐 or funny 👍). Then, please tell us how much you understand the context of the headline. Optionally, you can provide a reasoning on your humor rating. </p>
            <p>Below the edited headline, the AI-generated context gives you a better understanding on the context of the news. Then, the AI-generated reasoning provides you with a reasoning to assess if the edited headline is/isn't funny. <em>They are just offering you suggestions, so you don't have to always rely on them!</em></p>
            <p>
              To fit a 10-minute time frame, you will need to do
              <strong><span style="color: #4CAF50;"><span id="limit-placeholder"></span></span></strong>
              trails/HITs on this task. Your progress is reflected on the very top of the page. Good luck!
            </p>
            <p style="color: #8c8c8c;">*Note: the headlines are from real news reports and probably contain political contents. Also, the headlines and the edited versions are directly obtained from a CS publication dataset <em>SemEval-2020 Task 7</em>. </p>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p><strong>Original headline:</strong> WHO calls for <span style="color: blue;">elimination</span> of trans fat by 2023</p>
            <p><strong>Edited headline:</strong> WHO calls for <span style="color: blue;">monetization</span> of trans fat by 2023</p>
            <p><strong>AI-generated context and reasoning:</strong> The original headline reports...</p>
            <p>As you see, the replaced word is elimination → monetization. And there are also AI-generated context and reasoning for your reference. You can rate the edited headline with [less funny 👎], [mediocre 😐] or [funny 👍], and tell us how much you understand the context of the headline.</p>

  {
    "original": " <span style=\"color: blue;\">Avalanches</span> in Afghanistan kill at least 54",
    "edited": " <span style=\"color: blue;\">Martians</span> in Afghanistan kill at least 54",
    "context": "The original headline reports on a tragic event where avalanches have resulted in the death of at least 54 people in Afghanistan. The edited headline replaces \"Avalanches\" with \"Martians,\" transforming the event into a fictional scenario involving extraterrestrial beings.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline stems from the absurd image of Martians being in Afghanistan and causing havoc, which is a clear parody. The unexpectedness of aliens in place of a natural disaster creates an amusing contrast, capitalizing on the surreal nature of extraterrestrial involvement. However, some might find it in poor taste since it is based on a tragic event, which could affect its reception."
  },
  {
    "original": "Thousands of Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv to accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of <span style=\"color: blue;\">corruption</span> ",
    "edited": "Thousands of Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv to accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of <span style=\"color: blue;\">cheating</span> ",
    "context": "The original headline reports on a protest by Israelis in Tel Aviv accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of corruption. The edited headline shifts the accusation to \"cheating,\" which is ambiguous and broadens the potential meaning beyond political corruption.",
    "reason": "The humor, if any, in the edited headline arises from the unexpected replacement of a serious accusation\u2014\"corruption\"\u2014with a more casual term, \"cheating,\" which could be associated with various types of misconduct (e.g., infidelity, academic dishonesty) rather than the specific political context. However, the humor is subtle and relies heavily on the reader making this connection, which may not immediately come across."
  },
  {
    "original": "Pence Creates His Own VP <span style=\"color: blue;\">Club</span> With Biden and Cheney",
    "edited": "Pence Creates His Own VP <span style=\"color: blue;\">dance</span> With Biden and Cheney",
    "context": "The original headline refers to Mike Pence, a former Vice President, creating a gathering or group including fellow former Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Dick Cheney. Mike Pence, Joe Biden, and Dick Cheney were all individuals who served at different times under different presidents.",
    "reason": "The edited headline replaces \"club\" with \"dance,\" which adds a humorous twist because it implies a more lighthearted and unexpected activity between these serious political figures. Dance is not typically associated with politicians gathering for formal matters, making the image unexpected and comedic. However, the humor is quite subtle and might not be strongly funny to many readers."
  },
  {
    "original": "Will Ant\u00f3nio Guterres be the UN 's best ever <span style=\"color: blue;\">secretary</span> general ?",
    "edited": "Will Ant\u00f3nio Guterres be the UN 's best ever <span style=\"color: blue;\">fashion</span> general ?",
    "context": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The original headline questions whether he will be the best Secretary-General in the organization's history.",
    "reason": "The edited headline replaces \"secretary general\" with \"fashion general.\" This substitution is an attempt at humor by placing Guterres in an unexpected context of fashion, which is unrelated to his role as a political and diplomatic leader. The humor derives from the absurdity and incongruity of imagining a global political leader in a frivolous or unrelated position of fashion rather than diplomacy and governance. However, it may not be very impactful as the joke relies heavily on wordplay without offering a deeper punchline or clever twist."
  },
  {
    "original": "Trump , Russian <span style=\"color: blue;\">spies</span> and the infamous \u2018 golden shower memos \u2019",
    "edited": "Trump , Russian <span style=\"color: blue;\">dressing</span> and the infamous \u2018 golden shower memos \u2019",
    "context": "The original headline refers to a controversial and infamous dossier that contained allegations about Donald Trump's activities, including interactions with Russian operatives and a colorful but unverified claim about a \"golden shower\" in a Moscow hotel. The dossier became widely known as the Steele Dossier and was part of the discussion regarding alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.",
    "reason": "The edited headline replaces \"Russian spies\" with \"Russian dressing,\" a type of salad dressing, making a lighthearted switch from a serious political and espionage context to a more mundane and culinary one. This play on words using \"Russian dressing\" creates a juxtaposition and absurdity that relies on the reader's knowledge of the original context and injects a sense of humor by trivializing the serious subject of the original headline. However, the humor may not be universally accessible or appreciated, as it largely depends on the reader's familiarity with both Russian dressing and the Steele Dossier allegations."
  },
  {
    "original": "South Korean <span style=\"color: blue;\">newspaper</span> wants country to build its own nuclear arsenal amid North Korea threat",
    "edited": "South Korean <span style=\"color: blue;\">nun</span> wants country to build its own nuclear arsenal amid North Korea threat",
    "context": "The edited headline refers to the ongoing geopolitical tension on the Korean Peninsula, with South Korea potentially feeling threatened by North Korea's nuclear capabilities. The original headline suggests a nationalistic call from a South Korean newspaper for the country to develop its nuclear arsenal. The edit replaces \"newspaper\" with \"nun,\" which is unexpected.",
    "reason": "The humor stems from the absurdity and image of a nun, who traditionally embodies peace, humility, and non-violence, advocating for nuclear weapons, which are associated with destruction and conflict. This juxtaposition creates a surprising and quirky image, although some might not find it inherently humorous without further context or elaboration."
  },
  {
    "original": "Trump Repeals Regulation Protecting Workers From <span style=\"color: blue;\">Wage</span> Theft",
    "edited": "Trump Repeals Regulation Protecting Workers From <span style=\"color: blue;\">lunch</span> Theft",
    "context": "The original headline discusses a political action by former President Trump to repeal a regulation intended to protect workers from wage theft, which is the illegal withholding of wages or denial of benefits rightfully owed to an employee. The edited headline changes \"wage theft\" to \"lunch theft.\"",
    "reason": "The edited headline is aiming for humor through exaggeration and trivialization. It suggests that workers are being protected from having their lunches stolen, which is an absurd and humorous twist on the more serious issue of protecting wages. The humor comes from the juxtaposition of the seriousness of wage theft with the absurdity of the idea of needing federal regulations to protect workers from someone stealing their lunch."
  },
  {
    "original": "Poll Shows Most Doubt Trump 's Respect for <span style=\"color: blue;\">Institutions</span> ",
    "edited": "Poll Shows Most Doubt Trump 's Respect for <span style=\"color: blue;\">Wife</span> ",
    "context": "The original headline refers to a poll indicating that many people question former President Donald Trump's respect for established institutions, likely in a political or governmental context. The edited headline changes the focus to questioning Trump's respect for his wife.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline comes from the sudden and unexpected shift from a political matter to a personal one, especially given the well-documented public interest and speculation about Trump's marital relationships. This surprise element and play on the idea of 'respect' in a different context can be amusing for those familiar with Trump's history and media portrayal. However, the joke might not land as well for everyone or could be seen as too focused on personal matters."
  },
  {
    "original": "CA Poll : Plurality Disapprove of Pelosi <span style=\"color: blue;\">Job</span> Performance",
    "edited": "CA Poll : Plurality Disapprove of Pelosi <span style=\"color: blue;\">rap</span> Performance",
    "context": "The original headline discusses Californian public opinion regarding Nancy Pelosi's performance in her political role. The edited headline jokingly suggests that Pelosi is involved in a rap performance, which is a humorous and fictional twist on her usual political persona.",
    "reason": "The humor arises from the absurdity and incongruity of imagining Nancy Pelosi, a well-known political figure, engaging in rap music, which is drastically different from her actual occupation. Additionally, the unexpected juxtaposition of \"rap performance\" with \"disapprove\" creates a comical image of something far removed from reality."
  },
  {
    "original": "Oregon man dies ' peacefully ' after told <span style=\"color: blue;\">Trump</span> 's been impeached",
    "edited": "Oregon man dies ' peacefully ' after told <span style=\"color: blue;\">wife</span> 's been impeached",
    "context": "The original headline discusses an Oregon man who dies peacefully after being informed about President Trump's impeachment, potentially suggesting that he was content with the political news. The edited headline replaces \"Trump\" with the man's \"wife,\" implying that the wife being \"impeached\" brought him peace somehow, which is an impossible and humorous twist given that impeachment is not applicable to spouses.",
    "reason": "The edited headline creates a humorous and absurd situation by applying a political term, usually reserved for public officials, to a personal relationship. The idea of a wife being \"impeached\" is nonsensical and unexpected, creating a comical image. However, the humor is quite dependent on context and might not resonate with all audiences, as it's essentially a play on the unexpected juxtaposition of terms."
  },
  {
    "original": "Schwarzenegger launches new effort to <span style=\"color: blue;\">counter</span> Trump on climate",
    "edited": "Schwarzenegger launches new effort to <span style=\"color: blue;\">destroy</span> Trump on climate",
    "context": "The original headline discusses Arnold Schwarzenegger's initiative to address climate change as a counteraction to Donald Trump's policies or stance on the issue. This presents Schwarzenegger as someone trying to mitigate or offer an alternative to Trump's approach to climate issues.",
    "reason": "The edited headline escalates the situation to a more aggressive or dramatic confrontation by using the word \"destroy\" instead of \"counter.\" This choice of words humorously exaggerates the notion of political opposition, likening it to a more action-packed or film-like scenario reminiscent of Schwarzenegger\u2019s movie roles. The humor comes from the hyperbolic language and the playful nod to Schwarzenegger as an actor known for action films that involve \"destroying\" the opposition."
  },
  {
    "original": "Fla . Gov. Rick Scott expected in Washington to <span style=\"color: blue;\">raise</span> money for widely anticipated Senate run",
    "edited": "Fla . Gov. Rick Scott expected in Washington to <span style=\"color: blue;\">waste</span> money for widely anticipated Senate run",
    "context": "The original headline reports that Florida Governor Rick Scott is in Washington trying to raise money for his anticipated Senate run, which is a common practice for political candidates seeking campaign funding.",
    "reason": "The edited headline replaces \"raise money\" with \"waste money,\" suggesting the fundraising efforts are futile or misdirected. This substitution mocks the financial aspects of political campaigns, implying that pouring money into such endeavors could be wasteful or ineffective. The humor arises from this cynical twist, indicating skepticism about the effectiveness or utility of campaign fundraising practices."
  },
  {
    "original": " <span style=\"color: blue;\">Affirmative Action</span> : Now More Than Ever",
    "edited": " <span style=\"color: blue;\">Booze</span> : Now More Than Ever",
    "context": "The original headline refers to the need for affirmative action, likely in the context of ongoing social or political discussions. The edited headline replaces \"Affirmative Action\" with \"Booze,\" suggesting an increased reliance or consumption of alcohol in the current times.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline is derived from the unexpected and absurd substitution of a serious social policy with alcohol. It plays on the idea that people might be turning to alcohol as a coping mechanism due to stress or societal issues. The humor taps into a shared cultural understanding that sometimes people jokingly suggest more drinking in challenging times, creating a juxtaposition between a weighty issue and a frivolous resolution."
  },
  {
    "original": "North Korean <span style=\"color: blue;\">Official</span> : Situation in a ' Vicious Cycle '",
    "edited": "North Korean <span style=\"color: blue;\">drier</span> : Situation in a ' Vicious Cycle '",
    "context": "The original headline is about a North Korean official commenting on the country's situation, describing it as being in a \"vicious cycle,\" presumably referring to economic, political, or social issues. The edited headline replaces \"Official\" with \"drier,\" creating a play on words by implying that a laundry dryer is involved in the situation.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline comes from the wordplay between \"vicious cycle\" (a phrase commonly used to describe a repeating series of adverse circumstances) and \"cycle\" being a setting on a dryer. The term \"vicious cycle\" is repurposed to humorously suggest that instead of a political situation, it's laundry being stuck in a never-ending dryer cycle. This is a pun that relies on a double meaning that links the political metaphor with a household appliance situation. However, the humor might not be immediately clear to everyone and requires some understanding of both the original context and the pun."
  },
  {
    "original": "Trump Paid About $ 38 Million In Federal <span style=\"color: blue;\">Taxes</span> In 2005 , Leaked Returns Say",
    "edited": "Trump Paid About $ 38 Million In Federal <span style=\"color: blue;\">Bribes</span> In 2005 , Leaked Returns Say",
    "context": "The original headline is reporting on the leaked tax returns of former President Donald Trump from the year 2005, specifically noting how much he paid in federal taxes. The edited headline has replaced \"taxes\" with \"bribes,\" suggesting a humorous or satirical take on Trump's financial dealings.",
    "reason": "The edited headline attempts to create humor by implying that Trump paid \"bribes\" instead of taxes, which is a play on the common narrative or accusation of corruption or questionable ethics associated with him in media and public discussions. The humor comes from the absurdity and implausibility of such a blatant act being recorded in a tax return, reflecting mistrust or cynicism about Trump's financial transparency. However, the joke may be somewhat predictable or overdone given the constant satire surrounding Trump's finances."
  },
  {
    "original": "Moscow storm : 11 killed as high <span style=\"color: blue;\">winds</span> strike Russian capital",
    "edited": "Moscow storm : 11 killed as high <span style=\"color: blue;\">stoners</span> strike Russian capital",
    "context": "The original headline reports a tragic event in which a storm with high winds resulted in the deaths of 11 people in Moscow. The edited headline replaces \"high winds\" with \"high stoners.\"",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline arises from the unexpected substitution of \"stoners\" (a colloquial term for people who use marijuana) for \"winds.\" This creates an absurd visual of stoners somehow causing destruction in Moscow, which contrasts starkly with the seriousness of the original event. However, the humor might not resonate with everyone due to the insensitivity of making light of a tragic circumstance involving loss of life."
  },
  {
    "original": "Eyeing an election , Austria 's far-right <span style=\"color: blue;\">Freedom Party</span> commits to EU",
    "edited": "Eyeing an election , Austria 's far-right <span style=\"color: blue;\">gecko</span> commits to EU",
    "context": "The original headline refers to Austria's far-right Freedom Party showing support for the European Union ahead of an election, which is noteworthy given the party's typical skepticism or opposition towards EU policies.",
    "reason": "The edited headline replaces \"Freedom Party\" with \"gecko.\" This change introduces an absurd element, as geckos, being small reptiles, have no capacity for political commitments or decision-making. The humor comes from the randomness and unexpected nature of a gecko, a creature unrelated to political movements, supposedly making a commitment to the EU. Additionally, the imagery of a gecko being politically active adds a layer of whimsical absurdity."
  },
  {
    "original": "Bernie Sanders ' <span style=\"color: blue;\">Son</span> Is Extremely Mad Online",
    "edited": "Bernie Sanders ' <span style=\"color: blue;\">Grandmother</span> Is Extremely Mad Online",
    "context": "The original headline humorously refers to Bernie Sanders' son being \"extremely mad online,\" possibly implying a rant or emotionally charged social media post. The edited headline swaps \"son\" for \"grandmother.\"",
    "reason": "The edited headline is humorous because it plays on the unexpected image of an elderly grandmother being \"extremely mad online,\" which is not a typical scenario associated with grandmothers. It leverages the contrast between the stereotype of a gentle, kind grandmother and the idea of someone being intensely upset and voicing it on social media, which adds a layer of absurdity."
  },
  {
    "original": "Trump \u2019s Rhetoric Helpless Against Rise of <span style=\"color: blue;\">Trade</span> Deficit With China",
    "edited": "Trump \u2019s Rhetoric Helpless Against Rise of <span style=\"color: blue;\">cheese</span> Deficit With China",
    "context": "The original headline is about Donald Trump's rhetoric failing to address or impact the trade deficit between the United States and China. The edited headline changes the topic from a trade deficit to a 'cheese deficit' with China.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline arises from the absurdity of the concept of a 'cheese deficit' with China. Trade deficits are typically discussed in terms of economic goods and services like electronics, cars, or raw materials, rather than something as trivial as cheese. The contrast between serious economic issues and the triviality of cheese creates a sense of absurdity, which can be amusing. However, the humor relies heavily on the reader's familiarity with economic discussions and cheese's unlikely placement in such a context."
  },
  {
    "original": "' Matilda ' film on last czar 's <span style=\"color: blue;\">affair</span> , sparks controversy in Russia",

The edited headline changes \"poisoning\" to \"teasing.\"",
    "reason": "The humor here attempts to come from the stark contrast between the severity of the original accusation (poisoning) and the trivial nature implied by the edited word (teasing). Swapping a deadly and politically charged act like poisoning with a much lighter and harmless concept like teasing might evoke a sense of absurdity or an unexpected twist. However, it might not be universally humorous as the situation in the original headline was quite serious, making the humor potentially feel misplaced or dark rather than amusing."

The edited headline replaces \"fire\" with \"palpate,\" which means to examine or explore by touch.",

It introduces an unexpected and out-of-place physical action that contrasts sharply with the original call to remove Mueller from his position, implying a bizarre scenario where Trump would be asked to physically inspect Mueller instead of firing him. However, the joke lacks a strong connection or relevance to the actual events or figures involved and therefore may not resonate well with readers."

The edited version replaces \"lying\" with \"helping,\" completely altering the implication of Putin's actions in a satirical manner.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline arises from the contradiction and irony; accusing someone of lying suggests misconduct, while saying someone is \"helping\" suggests a positive action. This unexpected twist and the complete reversal of meaning provide an element of satire, highlighting the absurdity of such a situation. However, it relies heavily on the reader's awareness of political nuances and the nature of international relations, and its impact is mild."

    "reason": "The humor comes from the absurdity and anti-climactic twist. A 'lost continent' is typically an enormous, significant find associated with the vastness of oceans or archaeological digs, while finding it 'under rock' comically downplays its importance, reducing a major discovery to something trivial and mundane."

The edited version substitutes \"minority students\" with \"art students,\" shifting the focus to a different group.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline comes from the unexpected and somewhat arbitrary switch from \"minority students\" to \"art students.\" This substitution is amusing because it suggests that art students, typically not associated with causing safety concerns or needing specific disciplinary policies, were the cause of the increased unsafety, which is a nonsensical notion.

It plays on Trump's often hyperbolic manner of speaking, reducing it to a personal, everyday scenario many people can relate to. The incongruity between the gravity of Venezuela's political situation and the normalcy of a messy bedroom is what brings humor to this twist."

The edited version changes \"smiley\" to \"smelly,\" creating a play on words by using a homophone that sounds similar but has a completely different meaning.",
    "reason": "The attempt at humor here is based on wordplay, using \"smelly\" instead of \"smiley.\" The humor draws from the unexpected and absurd nature of the suggestion that a visual portrait could resemble something related to odor. Moreover, it subtly criticizes Trump by implying something unpleasant. However, the joke's reliance on a homophone isn't particularly clever or original, as it mainly swaps one easily recognizable word for another while keeping the structure intact without much additional creativity."

    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline arises from the absurdity and unexpected nature of the term \"blood pact.\" A blood pact is an ancient and somewhat arcane notion typically associated with secretive, sacred, or mystical agreements often depicted in fictional works. By substituting \"climate pact\" with \"blood pact,\" the writer adds an element of drama and mysticism, which contrasts humorously with the political and environmental context of the original headline. It's funny because it's an exaggeration and an unexpected metaphor that invites the reader to imagine Trump being involved in something more mysterious than climate policy, which he is famously skeptical about."

This implies that Jerome Powell, a person, is being treated like an object to be repurposed, which is an absurd and comical notion. The humor arises from the absurdity and the casual tone suggesting familiarity with a person who's already holding a similar position, making it seem like a work of recycling or upcycling."

    "reason": "The humor here attempts to come from the absurdity of the idea that inanimate objects like \"coffees\" could pay a minimum wage.

    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline arises from the absurdity and unexpectedness of a dog being associated with a financial or corporate scandal.

    "context": "The original headline reports on rising tensions and violence resulting in six deaths in Baghdad, specifically among Shi'ite groups. The edited version replaces \"clashes\" with \"hoedown,\" a term often associated with lighthearted, social dancing events typically found in rural American culture.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edit stems from the juxtaposition of a serious context (a violent clash with fatalities) with the word \"hoedown,\" which conjures imagery of a fun, harmless gathering. This stark contrast between the gravity of the situation and the light-hearted word creates an absurd and unexpected twist intended to evoke humor. However, the sensitive nature of the topic (violence and death) can overshadow or diminish the comedic effect, making the attempt at humor potentially offensive or inappropriate."

    "context": "Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, was dismissed from his position and became a controversial figure. The original headline mentions that Flynn \"has a story to tell,\" implying he might reveal important information or secrets, which is common in political scenarios where figures write memoirs or tell-alls.",
    "reason": "The edited headline changes \"tell\" to \"write,\" suggesting a more literal take that Flynn should just write down his experiences. The humor might stem from the expectation that everyone involved in significant political scandals ends up writing a book. However, the joke here is pretty subtle and may not evoke a strong humorous reaction. It\u2019s more about making the headline sound like an ordinary instruction rather than the potentially explosive revelations readers might expect."

The original headline refers to a farewell party being thrown for him by the White House staff.",
    "reason": "The edited headline replaces \"farewell party\" with \"pizza party,\" which lightens the tone and injects humor by suggesting a child's party concept for a rather formal and significant event like a farewell. The contrast between the expected decorum for a White House staff farewell event and the informality of a pizza party provides the humor.

It suggests that the opioid crisis receives more empathy because it predominantly affects white communities, whereas the crack epidemic predominantly affected African American communities and was treated more harshly.",

The idea of zombies being close to the president and having an opinion about Kushner's employment status is unexpected and ludicrous.

    "reason": "The edited headline attempts to create humor by replacing a human victim with a dog. In this context, the absurdity lies in the unlikely scenario of a dog being in a courtroom and involved in such a dramatic incident.

It's a political and diplomatic issue. The edited headline plays on the phrase by replacing \"life\" with \"palate,\" a term related to the sense of taste.",
    "reason": "The humor attempt in the edited headline comes from the play on words where \"life\" has been replaced with \"palate.\" The use of \"palate\" in this context is nonsensical and irrelevant to the topic at hand. \"Palate\" is not typically associated with political situations or being made difficult, especially in reference to an individual's political or public affairs.

The original headline suggests he's notorious for his controversial viewpoints and conspiracy theorizing. The edited headline twists the original narrative, implying he is now championing theories about aliens.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline comes from the absurdity and unexpected turn it presents. By switching \"conspiracy theorist\" to \"alien theorist,\" it amplifies the already controversial reputation of Hannity but in a way that seems more fictional and outlandish. This makes it amusing because it exaggerates his reputation in a way that feels more comedic and less politically charged, potentially appealing to those who find the concept of UFOs and aliens inherently funny."

The imagined concept of a massively expensive cake purchased by Wall Street from Obama plays on the stereotype of extravagant Wall Street spending and the incongruity of buying an overly expensive cake.

    "reason": "Humor often arises from subverting expectations or presenting a contrast between a serious subject and a trivial or lighter one.

    "reason": "The humor attempt here seems to come from swapping \"raids\" with \"boasting,\" suggesting that individuals were apprehended because they were bragging about their involvement in or ability to prevent a terrorist attack. The humor could arise from the absurdity of the situation where mere boasting leads to arrest. However, the word change does not significantly enhance the comedic value, as boasting about stopping an attack is not inherently a funny concept without additional context or exaggeration.

Movies are generally not things you can physically escape from, so the incongruity of a person climbing out of a roof to escape a movie setting provides a mild element of surprise and absurdity.

    "reason": "The edited headline attempts to switch the focus from a well-known and controversial topic (Trump) to something more general and mundane (cheap hotels). The humor might come from downplaying a sensitive political issue by attributing the avoidance to the hotels being \"cheap\" instead of possibly being politically motivated.

It's humorous because it contrasts the serious subject of the original headline with the image of people throwing parties at the border, which is an unlikely and ridiculous concept. However, the level of humor could be considered quite low-brow and simplistic, relying solely on the unexpected swap of words."

    "edited": "What would happen if Trump sparked a <span style=\"color: blue;\">thumb</span> war with China ?",
    "context": "The original headline discusses the serious implications of a potential trade war between the United States and China under Trump's administration. The edited headline substitutes \"trade war\" with \"thumb war,\" a children's game usually used to decide trivial matters or for fun.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline comes from the absurdity and trivialization of a significant geopolitical issue. By suggesting a \"thumb war\" instead of a \"trade war,\" the headline creates a humorous juxtaposition of a serious matter with something inconsequential and childish. The unexpected substitution provides a comedic twist, highlighting the difference between international diplomacy and a lighthearted game."

    "context": "The original headline discusses accusations against YouTube for allegedly exposing young children to inappropriate or harmful content, described as 'violence.' The edited headline changes the issue from kids' content to kids' 'breakfast.'",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline arises from the absurdity and unexpectedness of the change from a serious issue (violence in content) to something mundane and non-threatening (breakfast). The exaggeration or the incongruity of associating 'violence' with something as benign as breakfast can create a comedic effect. However, the joke may not be very strong since the connection between 'breakfast' and 'violence' isn't evident or inherently funny; it relies solely on absurdity."

    "original": "Iranian general threatens to ' <span style=\"color: blue;\">bury</span> ' Donald Trump",
    "edited": "Iranian general threatens to ' <span style=\"color: blue;\">wedgie</span> ' Donald Trump",
    "context": "The original headline reports on a threatening statement by an Iranian general towards Donald Trump, using the word \"bury\" metaphorically to suggest defeat or destruction. The edited version replaces this threatening language with a much less severe and more juvenile action: giving a \"wedgie\" to Donald Trump.",
    "reason": "The humor arises from the contrast between the severity of the original threat (\"bury\") and the childish and relatively harmless nature of a \"wedgie.\" This substitution creates an absurd and silly image that deflates the seriousness of the original statement. The idea of a high-ranking military figure resorting to a schoolyard prank brings an unexpected and comical element to the intense political context."

    "edited": "Rwanda <span style=\"color: blue;\">pets</span> 37 petty criminals , Human Rights Watch says - BBC News",
    "context": "The original headline reports on a serious issue involving the alleged killing of 37 petty criminals by Rwandan authorities, as highlighted by Human Rights Watch. The edited headline humorously changes \"killed\" to \"pets,\" suggesting a completely different and benign action.",
    "reason": "The humor arises from the stark contrast between the severity of the original statement and the absurdity of the edited version. The action of \"petting\" is associated with gentle and positive behavior, which stands in sharp opposition to the violence implied by \"killed.\" This wordplay creates an unexpected twist that could evoke a chuckle due to its sheer implausibility and innocence. Additionally, the juxtaposition highlights the ineffectiveness or absurdity of the modification, focusing on the disparity between the seriousness of the alleged events and the edited version's benign and literal interpretation."

    "context": "The original headline discusses a serious humanitarian issue, highlighting the situation of over 10,000 migrant children being held in US government shelters across multiple states. The edited headline replaces \"children\" with \"llamas.\"",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline comes from the absurdity and unexpectedness of replacing children, a decidedly serious and human-related subject, with llamas, a type of animal that is neither common nor relevant to US immigration contexts. The mental image of llamas being held in shelters designed for human children creates a bizarre and comical scenario. However, the humor might be considered somewhat insensitively misplaced given the seriousness of the original topic."

    "context": "The original headline refers to political consultant James Carville's commentary on the Democratic Party, perhaps suggesting a lack of clear leadership or direction. The edited headline replaces \"Democratic Party\" with \"the abyss,\" implying a more dramatic, chaotic, and existential question of leadership or control.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline arises from the hyperbolic and surreal idea that someone could be in charge of \"the abyss,\" which is typically understood as a vast, empty nothingness. The idea humorously escalates Carville's critique of flawed leadership within a political party to the notion of managing an unmanageable void. However, not everyone might find it immediately amusing as it relies on understanding this absurd exaggeration."

    "context": "The original headline discusses a leading constitutional scholar's opinion regarding the legality of former FBI Director James Comey's firing by then-President Donald Trump, while also indicating that Trump may have committed impeachable offenses.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline arises from the adjective \"Exhausted\" replacing \"Leading.\" This substitution implies that the constitutional scholar is weary, potentially from dealing with an overwhelming or repetitive legal and political situation. The hyperbolic element of exhaustion adds a layer of relatability to the scholar's plight, which can be amusing. However, the humor remains subtle and largely context-dependent, relying on an understanding of the pressure-filled nature of political analysis during turbulent times."

    "context": "The original headline refers to a real event where former President Donald Trump criticized reporters for what he perceived as biased coverage of the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a white supremacist rally resulted in violence and was widely reported in the media. The edited headline creates a fictional scenario where Trump \"moons\" reporters in response to their coverage, a gesture that implies a childish or comedic form of disapproval.",
    "reason": "The humor in the edited headline comes from the absurdity and the exaggerated behavior attributed to a political figure known for his unorthodox methods and often contentious relationship with the press. The idea of an adult politician resorting to mooning as a form of protest is both unexpected and contrasts sharply with the seriousness of the actual event, creating a humorous clash of tones."

    "context": "The original headline relates to Michael Cohen, who was a personal lawyer for former President Donald Trump. The headline addresses the fact that Cohen continued to serve as Trump's lawyer despite being investigated or probed for potential legal issues.",
    "reason": "The edited headline replaces \"lawyer\" with \"playmate,\" which creates a humorous image by using a term more often associated with children's friends or certain adult magazines, rather than legal professionals. This unexpected substitution plays on the idea of a professional, serious relationship being replaced with something juvenile or frivolous, which can be amusing due to the absurdity and incongruity."
